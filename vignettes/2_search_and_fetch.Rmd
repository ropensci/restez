A downside of the `restez` approach is we are unable to then search the local database for sequences of interest as the database cannot possibly contain sufficient metadata (most notably taxonomic information) to perform as rich a search as online via NCBI. As a result we must perform the sequence discovery process independently from `restez`. In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to perform online searches using the `rentrez` package and then use the search results to look up sequences in a `restez` database.

To run all the code in this tutorial you will need to have already set up the rodents database, see [Build a database of all rodents](https://ropensci.github.io/restez/articles/1_rodents.html).

## Search NCBI GenBank accession numbers

Let's pretend we're interested in COI sequences for a group of rodents called the Sciuromorpha. `restez` provides the `ncbi_acc_get()` function to make this easy: just provide a text string query [like you would on NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK49540/), and it returns a character vector of accession numbers corresponding to that query. By default, it drops any version number after each accession number. This is not strictly necessary, but it makes it easier to check our results from `restez` later.


```r
library(restez)

# 33553 - Sciuromorpha - squirrel-like things
accessions <- ncbi_acc_get(
  'txid33553[Organism:exp] AND COI [GENE] AND 100:1000[SLEN]')
print(length(accessions))
#> [1] 492
print(accessions[1:10])
#>  [1] "MZ661159" "MZ364430" "HQ966965" "GU670702" "GU670701" "GU670700" "GU670699" "GU670462" "GU670451" "GU670450"
```

## Retrieve sequences

To fetch the sequences from the rodents database, we can use the `gb_fasta_get` function.



```r
restez_path_set(rodents_path)
coi_sequences <- gb_fasta_get(id = accessions)
str(coi_sequences[[1]])
#>  chr ">LT630607.1 Sciurus sp. 1 AG-2016 mitochondrial partial COI gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, specimen vou"| __truncated__
# Are all accessions in results?
all(accessions %in% names(coi_sequences))
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Comparing to Entrez

Can we not just use `rentrez` to do the fetching as well? Yes, but `restez` can be a lot faster. NCBI limits the number of requests per user, often to as little as 100 items per request with varying time delays. Additionally for any programmatic retrieval of sequences using an online server can never be as reliable as a local copy.


```r
# time via restez
system.time(expr = {
  coi_sequences <- gb_fasta_get(id = accessions)
  })
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.259   0.077   0.272
# time via Entrez
system.time(expr = {
  coi_sequences_p1 <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = 'nucleotide',
                                            id = accessions[1:100],
                                            rettype = 'fasta')
  coi_sequences_p2 <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = 'nucleotide',
                                            id = accessions[101:200],
                                            rettype = 'fasta')
  coi_sequences_p3 <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = 'nucleotide',
                                            id = accessions[201:300],
                                            rettype = 'fasta')
  coi_sequences_p4 <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = 'nucleotide',
                                            id = accessions[301:400],
                                            rettype = 'fasta')
  coi_sequences_p5 <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = 'nucleotide',
                                            id = accessions[401:456],
                                            rettype = 'fasta')
  })
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.050   0.008   5.536
```

## Missing

A user should know that if an ID cannot be found in the local database no error or warning is raised. This is why it can be good practice to test whether all the provided IDs are in the returned named vector. In this example, we can see that not all the accession IDs that were provided are in the returned `coi_sequences`. Why is that?


```r
# Are all accessions in results?
all(accessions %in% names(coi_sequences))
#> [1] TRUE
# .... no
```

This is because `restez` only downloads GenBank sequences, and these 'missing' sequence IDs are RefSeq sequences. GenBank, however, acts as the source database for RefSeq -- which is the case for other NCBI databases too -- and all the missing RefSeq sequences can also be found in GenBank under a different ID.

We can look up alternative IDs and test whether they are in our `accesssions` vector, so:


```r
(accessions[!accessions %in% names(coi_sequences)])
#> character(0)
# NC* refers to RefSeq sequences and are not available through restez
# The sequence exists in GB under a different id which we can find like so
smmry <- rentrez::entrez_summary(db = 'nucleotide', id = 'NC_027278')
# This ID does exist in our results.
(smmry$assemblyacc %in% accessions)
#> [1] FALSE
```
