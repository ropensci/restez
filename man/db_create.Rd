\usage{
db_create(
  db_type = "nucleotide",
  min_length = 0,
  max_length = NULL,
  acc_filter = NULL,
  invert = FALSE,
  alt_restez_path = NULL,
  scan = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_type}{character, database type}

\item{min_length}{Minimum sequence length, default 0.}

\item{max_length}{Maximum sequence length, default NULL.}

\item{acc_filter}{Character vector; accessions to include or exclude from
the database as specified by `invert`.}

\item{invert}{Logical vector of length 1; if TRUE, accessions in `acc_filter`
will be excluded from the database; if FALSE, only accessions in `acc_filter`
will be included in the databasse. Default FALSE.}

\item{alt_restez_path}{Alternative restez path if you would like to use the
downloads from a different restez path.}

\item{scan}{Logical vector of length 1; should the sequence file be scanned
for accessions in `acc_filter` prior to processing? Only used if
`acc_filter` is not NULL and `invert` is FALSE. Default FALSE.}
}
\description{
Create a new local SQL database from downloaded files.
Currently only GenBank/nucleotide/nuccore database is supported.
}
\details{
All .seq.gz files are added to the database by default. A user can specify
minimum/maximum sequence lengths or accession numbers to limit the sequences
to be added to the database -- smaller databases are faster to search. The
final selection of sequences is the result of applying all filters
(`acc_filter`, `min_length`, `max_length`) in combination.

The `scan` option can decrease the time needed to build a database if only a
small number of sequences should be written to the database compared to the
number of the sequences downloaded from GenBank; i.e., if many of the files
downloaded from GenBank do not contain any sequences that should be written
to the database. When set to TRUE, if a file does not contain any of the
accessions in `acc_filter`, further processing of that file will be skipped
and none of the sequences it contains will be added to the database.

Alternatively, a user can use the \code{alt_restez_path} to add the files
from an alternative restez file path. For example, you may wish to have a
database of all environmental sequences but then an additional smaller one of
just the sequences with lengths below 100 bp. Instead of having to download
all environmental sequences twice, you can generate multiple restez databases
using the same downloaded files from a single restez path.

This function will not overwrite a pre-existing database. Old databases must
be deleted before a new one can be created. Use \code{\link{db_delete}} with
everything=FALSE to delete an SQL database.

Connections/disconnections to the database are made automatically.
